                <h1>Right of Withdrawal / Cancellation Policy</h1>
                <p style="color: var(--text-tertiary); font-size: 0.88rem;">This cancellation policy applies only to consumers as defined by &sect; 13 BGB (German Civil Code).</p>

                <h2>Right of Withdrawal</h2>
                <p>You have the right to withdraw from this contract within <strong>fourteen days</strong> without giving any reason.</p>
                <p>The withdrawal period is fourteen days from the date of the conclusion of the contract.</p>
                <p>To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>of your decision to withdraw from this contract by means of a clear statement (e.g., a letter sent by post or email). You may use the model withdrawal form below, but it is not mandatory.</p>
                <p>To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your notification of the exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>

                <h2>Effects of Withdrawal</h2>
                <p>If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, without undue delay and in any event not later than fourteen days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We shall carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
                <p>If you requested that the services should commence during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated to us your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.</p>

                <h2>Early Expiration of the Right of Withdrawal</h2>
                <p>The right of withdrawal expires prematurely if we have begun to execute the contract only after you have given your express consent and at the same time confirmed your knowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal upon complete performance of the contract (&sect; 356(5) BGB).</p>
                <p>For a contract on the supply of digital content, the right of withdrawal also expires if the provider has begun to execute the contract after the consumer has expressly agreed that the provider shall begin performance before the expiry of the withdrawal period, and the consumer has confirmed their knowledge that by giving their consent they lose their right of withdrawal with the beginning of performance.</p>

                <h2>Model Withdrawal Form</h2>
                <p><em>(If you wish to withdraw from the contract, please fill in and return this form.)</em></p>
